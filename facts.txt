There are 18 penguin species and 13 of them are threatened.
Emperor Penguins are the tallest species, standing nearly 4 feet tall. The smallest is the Little Blue Penguin, which is only about 16 inches.
The fastest species is the Gentoo Penguin, which can reach swimming speeds up to 22 mph.
A penguin's striking coloring is a matter of camouflage; from above, its black back blends into the murky depths of the ocean. From below, its white belly is hidden against the bright surface.
Fossils place the earliest penguin relative at some 60 million years ago, meaning an ancestor of the birds we see today survived the mass extinction of the dinosaurs.
All but two species of penguins breed in large colonies of up to one thousand birds.
It varies by species, but many penguins will mate with the same member of the opposite sex season after season.
Penguin parents—both male and female—care for their young for several months until the chicks are strong enough to hunt for food on their own.
If a female Emperor Penguin's baby dies, she will often "kidnap" an unrelated chick.
The first published account of penguins comes from Antonio Pigafetta, who was aboard Ferdinand Magellan's first circumnavigation of the globe in 1520. They spotted the animals near what was probably Punta Tombo in Argentina. (He called them "strange geese.")
Because they aren't used to danger from animals on solid ground, wild penguins exhibit no particular fear of human tourists.
Penguins jump into the air before diving to swim faster. The move releases air bubbles from their feathers, cutting down on drag and doubling or tripling their speed underwater, according to Smithsonian. To make the leap back ashore, some smaller penguins can launch themselves 6 or 9 feet into the air by speedily swimming to the surface and bursting up over the ice shelf.
- [ ] In the deepest dive ever recorded by the Australian Antarctic Division, an emperor penguin reached an amazing 1,850 feet. Those huge depths require a great lung capacity; the longest known dives have lasted 22 minutes!
- [ ] They can drink seawater. While penguins sip meltwater from pools and streams when they're thirsty, their hunting style and diet necessitates a cool adaptation. A supraorbital gland located above their eye removes salt from the bloodstream. The excess sodium then comes out through the bill or by sneezing!
- [ ] Scientists still don't know for sure how many kinds there are. Estimates usually fall in the range of 17 to 20, as there's still some debate over whether similar types of penguins (like rockhoppers) actually count as different species.
- [ ] Penguins don't have teeth. Fleshy spines inside their mouths help them swallow fish. The protrusions face backward to help guide the catch down their throats.
- [ ] Couples locate each other with distinct calls. The unique sounds help them reunite on the breeding ground — a not-so-easy task when there are thousands of identical birds around.
- [ ] A group of penguins in the water is called a raft. These avid swimmers spend up to 80% of their lives out at sea! 
- [ ] Scientists can find penguins using poop. The abundance of dark excrement (called guano) produced by large colonies allows researchers to see the groups from space! The smelly giveaway just revealed a 1.5 million member "super-colony" of Adelie penguins in the Danger Islands.
- [ ] Penguins are specially adapted to sink. While most birds have hollow bones to facilitate flight, penguins have dense skeletons for easier diving, according to BBC Wildlife Magazine.
- [ ] Some penguins build pebble nests. Gentoo penguins' "nests" look so ramshackle that ornithologists actually call them scrapes. The parents do line the pile of rocks with soft moss and feathers, though. Others dig out cozy burrows. Little penguins tunnel holes in the sand dunes, typically a passageway leading to a "nest bowl" just large enough to stand up in. The males and females take turns incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks until they reach about 8 or 9 weeks old.
- [ ] Not all penguins live in the Arctic. The Galápagos penguin stays nice and warm living near the equator. In fact, they're the only penguin species found outside of the Southern Hemisphere.
- [ ] Penguins huddle for warmth. Emperor penguins have perfected their group hugs to a science, with some birds in the middle actually getting too hot in negative-degree temperatures and needing to waddle their way out. Then the guys on the outskirts get their turn soaking up the heat.
- [ ] They love "tobogganing." Instead of shuffling across the ice, many penguins like to lay on their stomachs and propel themselves with their feet. It's often a faster way to get around and it's just plain fun, okay?
- [ ] Penguin chicks start out as little fluffballs. Their first coat of feathers consists of a light down. The weatherproof layer grows in later, but they look quite cute in the meantime.
